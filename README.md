# Tamagotchi-Creche
An automated system that generates a flood of Tamagotchi and cares for them throughout their lifecycle.

My aim is to create a mechanism that spawns Tamagotchi and instantiates a single worker that cycles through them caring for them, until a critical mass is reached where the worker can no longer keep up and the majority of the Tamagotchi die. This may sound morbid, but it will be an effective benchmark of the performance of any regular CPU, because the faster it can manage Tamagotchi, the better it must be. Hopefully one day in the future we will measure CPU power not by MegaHertz, but by MegaTamagotchi.

Truly, Tamagotchi benchmarking is the way humanity should, neigh, MUST, evolve.
